# Energy Management System (EMS)
This software will monitor and manage the LabREI microgrid.

## Introduction
EMS will provide the following services:
    - Optimal day-ahead dispatch of the available distributed energy resources;
    - Monitoring and management of LabREI microgrid, where data will be stored in a database (MySQL);
    - Real-time visualization of microgrid operation;
    - Visualization of dispatchs defined by the economic dispatch optimizer;
    - Configuration of hourly energy prices from the main network, thermal generation costs and load curtailment costs.
