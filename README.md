# Energy Management System (EMS) with EVs

## Introduction
A program that uses tools like Python, MySQL, Docker and Angular in its development.

EMS will provide the following services:
* Optimal day-ahead dispatch of the available distributed energy resources (DER);
* Monitoring and management of CampusGrid microgrid, modeled and simulated in the Typhoon HIL (Hardware in the Loop);
* Microgrid operation data is stored in a MySQL database;
* Real-time visualization of microgrid operation;
* Visualization of dispatchs defined by the economic dispatch optimizer;
* Configuration of hourly energy prices from the main network, thermal generation costs and load curtailment costs.
